Take all of the files in the 'LANG' Folder and put them in 'ckHUD/resource'

Should look like this

-TF
| -Custom
|   -ckHUD
|     -resource
|       -chat_brazilian.txt
|       -chat_english.txt
|       -chat_french.txt
|       -chat_german.txt
|       -chat_italian.txt
|       -chat_polish.txt
|       -chat_russian.txt
|       -chat_spanish.txt

Then put 'BotDetectorVoteHUD.res' and 'clientscheme_votehud' in the #customization/enabled folder

**THIS REQUIRES A GAME RESTART TO FUNCTION PROPERLY**

NOTE: from my benchmarking, this eats up like 1 fps, but its very useful.
