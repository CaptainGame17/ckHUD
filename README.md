# ckHUD

**THIS HUD IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!**

A hud made by conch, inspired by EVE Hud, Issac Hud, and ToonHud.

# Compatibility
Cuurently only being tested on 1080p. If anyone else wants to test for me you can add me on discord.

# Customizations

So far we have:

* A minmode that moves the main hud elements down.
* Built in transparent viewmodels. (in scripts/hudlayout.res)
* Crosshairs and Hitmarkers. (in scripts/hudlayout.res)
* Alternative Uber: A different style of uber that puts the meter on the right side instead of centering it. (in #customizations) **(slightly broken)**

Please credit!
