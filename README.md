# ckHUD

**THIS HUD IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!**

A hud made by conch, think of it as the sucessor to kritzhud.

# Compatibility
Cuurently only being tested on 1080p. If anyone else wants to test for me you can add me on discord.

# Customizations

So far we have:

* A minmode that moves the main hud elements down.
* Built in transparent viewmodels. (in scripts/hudlayout.res)
* Crosshairs and Hitmarkers. (in scripts/hudlayout.res)
* Alternative Uber: A different style of uber that puts the meter on the right side instead of centering it. (in #customizations) **(slightly broken)**

If you wish to customize the hud even more (use it as a base for a different hud), go ahead. I've sprinked some comments in some of the files.
Just please credit me if you do use this hud in other huds and plan to release it.
