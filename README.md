# Customizations

So far we have:

* A minmode that moves the main hud elements down.
* Built in transparent viewmodels. (in scripts/hudlayout.res)
* Crosshairs and Hitmarkers. (in scripts/hudlayout.res)
* Alternative Uber: A different style of uber that puts the meter on the right side instead of centering it. (in #customizations) **(slightly broken)**

Please credit!
